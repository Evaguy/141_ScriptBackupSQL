# How to setup the scripts in Windows
The script itself is mostly based using this [Quora article](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-backup-MySQL-and-PostgreSQL-databases-from-Windows-Server-2012R2-using-PowerShell-scripts). Also this is the first time I've ever used PowerShell lol :-).

Comments, in this script, are in French... Maybe, I'll change them to English who knows...

## TODO:
- Remove the pre-existing variable in the scripts
- Perphaps changing/cleaning the comments so that they're more "readable" and more "understandable"
- Translate the comments, in the script, into English
- Explain how to setup everything in Windows
