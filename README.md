# 141_ScriptBackupSQL
Source code of a project in school for the IT branch 141.

The script itself is mostly based using this [Quora article](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-backup-MySQL-and-PostgreSQL-databases-from-Windows-Server-2012R2-using-PowerShell-scripts). Also this is the first time I've ever used PowerShell lol :-)

There should be soon a technical documentation (in French sadly) explaning how the script works, if I'm not lazy and if I don't forget. 

Comments in this script are also in French...

## Objective
Automate a backup of 3 DBs using any programming language and any automation app.

I used PowerShell and Task Scheduler or System Agent. And I'm running XAMPP.

## TODO 
- Perphaps chaning the comments so that they're more "readable" and more "understandable"
- Finsish and add the technical documentation
