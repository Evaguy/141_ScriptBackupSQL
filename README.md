# 141_ScriptBackupSQL
Source code of a project in school/EPSIC for the ICT branch 141.

This is just scripts, in Powershell and Bash, to backup MySQL databases with the command : "mysqldump".

Small notice : I haven't tested the Bash script, so expect some errors while using it :/.

## TODO:
- Try adding a way, for the users, ~~to use a XML file or a JSON file, or any other text file~~, this will likely be a .ini file, but anyway still looking for an option, instead of modifing directly the variables in the script. Don't know if it's possible though...
- Rewrite the README again ? Make it more clear idk ??
- Add a documentation on how to setup everything, both on Windows and Linux.
